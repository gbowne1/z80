# z80

Z80 PC with 8 bit ISA backplane.

This will be my design for a Z80 computer (not just a SBC) with a backplane with a minimum of four (4) 8bit ISA type bus slots / card edge connectors.

This design uses the most common 74 Series logic chips used in many Z80 designs.

The board is meant to fit in a modern PC case and is ATX class sized @ roughly 9" x 12" (22.86cm x 30.48cm)

This project was created with KiCAD 5.1.x.

I originally started working on this project in 2003.

Due to personal time constraints and so many ongoing projects, I would like some help from the community to help me finish this project.
